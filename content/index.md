I work as an assistant at the Institute of Social Ethics at the Center for Ethcis of the University of Zürich where I teach theological ethics and research into healthcare-chaplaincy and medical ethics.

### How I got here
I have studied theology at the Universities of Göttingen and Münster (Germany) as well as at Candler School of Theology, Emory University, Atlanta (USA). During my studies I was especially interested in biomedical ethics as well as on pastoral care and counselling.

In my magister-thesis I evaluated and systemized current research on healthcare-chaplains' participation in ethical decision making.
Alongside my studies I finished my training as an EMT and worked part time in rescue services gaining pracitical experience providing immediate medical care for patients in emergency situations.

### What I'm working on
My dissertation-project focusses on the ways hospital chaplains are involved with ethics-counselling and ethical decision-making. I aim at exploring how pastoral care and ethical decision-making are intertwined and influence each other – especially since they come together in one professional person.

The project takes an empirical approach. In the first stage I use an online-survey to learn more about with what fields of ethical conflicts chaplains get in touch with. Building on these findings I am going to design interviews to investigate more on the ways chaplains deal with different professional roles and settings when providing pastoral care and ethics-counselling.

The doctorate-project is supervised by Traugott Roser (Professor of Practical Theology, University of Münster) and Michael Coors (Professor of Theological Ethics, University of Zürich).
